THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS DAY,
AND THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

ORDER

Marriage of the petitioner and the respondent was
solemnized on 28.02.1994.

Out of the wedlock, they

have a daughter and a son. Crl.Misc.No.87/2010 filed
by the petitioner was decided on 03.12.2013 and the
respondent was directed to deposit Rs.16 Lakhs, to be
apportioned in equal proportion between the two
children.

Seeking enforcement of the said order,

Crl.Misc.7/2014 was filed. A joint memo having been
filed, the said petition was disposed of on 11.11.2014.
In terms of the agreement, Rs.8 Lakhs was deposited in



the name of each child, i.e., Kumari Abhigna Desai and
Master Ganesh i.e., in compliance of the order dated
03.12.2013 passed in Crl.Misc.No.87/2010.

The

amount having been deposited, was invested in Fixed
Deposit, in the Karnataka Bank Limited, to remain in
deposit till the minor son Master Ganesh attains the
age of majority.

The deposit made in the name of

Kumari Abhigna Desai was released in favour of the
petitioner.

2.
custody

Master Ganesh, presently being in the
of

the

father,

the

respondent

filed

an

application to direct the release of Rs.12, 098/-, being
the accrued interest on the said Fixed Deposit amount,
standing in the name of Master Ganesh.
prayer

having

been

allowed

by

an

The said

order

dated

26.05.2015, this petition was filed to set aside / quash
the said order.



3.

Sri. Sri.Madhukar Nadig, learned advocate,

contended that the respondent is not entitled to draw
the interest which has accrued on the Fixed Deposit
amount of Rs.8 Lakhs, deposited pursuant to the
orders

passed

by

the

learned

Crl.Misc.Nos.87/2010 and 7/2014.

Magistrate

in

Learned counsel

contended that by permitting the respondent to draw
the accumulated interest of Rs.12, 098/-, the interest
of the minor has not been protected by the learned
Magistrate.

4.

Respondent, party-in-person, on the other

hand, submitted that he not withdraws the Fixed
Deposit amount of Rs.8 Lakhs and the same would
remain in deposit, till Master Ganesh attains the age of
majority.

He submitted that the interest accrued on

the Fixed Deposit is required to be utilized for meeting



the educational expenses of his son, studying in 2nd
P.U.C. He submitted that in the said circumstances,
learned Magistrate is justified in passing the order
dated 26.05.2015 i.e. permitting him to withdraw the
interest amount of Rs.12,098/- accrued on the fixed
Deposit of Rs.8 Lakhs.

5.

Having regard to the submissions of the

learned counsel for the petitioner and the respondent,
in

my

opinion,

the

learned

Magistrate

has

not

committed any illegality in permitting the respondent
to make use of the accrued interest amount of
Rs.12,098/- on the Fixed Deposit amount of Rs.8
Lakhs standing in the name of the minor son - Master
Ganesh. There being no dispute that Master Ganesh is
studying in 2nd P.U.C., his educational expenditure has
to be met.
Lakhs

The respondent, having deposited Rs.16

pursuant

to

the

order

passed

in



Crl.Misc.87/2010, the interest earned there from, will
have to be utilized for the benefit of the children.
Keeping the said aspect in view, the learned Magistrate
has passed the impugned order and the same cannot
be characterized either as perverse or illegal.

6.

However,

the

respondent

shall

not

be

entitled to withdraw the sum, in Fixed Deposit, i.e.,
Rs.8 Lakhs, until permitted by a specific order of the
learned Magistrate. The deposit shall continue in the
name of Master Ganesh, till he attains majority and
further order is passed by the learned Magistrate in
Crl.Misc.No.87/2010 or Crl.Misc.No.7/2014.
In the result, petition being devoid of merit, is
rejected.
