It was a good win for the Indians. The contest was interesting and close. On the face of it though, it could have been an easy outing for the host. 

India came back into the game in a superb manner, even as Marcus Trescothick was all set to take the match away single- handedly. He proved to be the one-man army for England, and the Indians knew pretty well at that stage that his wicket would make the difference. 

I must say Trescothick paced his innings beautifully, handling the spinners very well, keeping the pressure on the opposition bowlers. 

The Indians displayed the right attitude on the field, keeping the Englishmen in check, positive in approach, concentrating on taking wickets rather than containing the flow of runs. 

On a wicket that was assisting spin, I thought our spinners bowled below par and almost let England off the hook. 

Young Dinesh Mongia batted superbly. He showed tremendous composure, did not let the pressure get the better of him. It was a responsible knock, with not a rash stroke. He looks to be a good No3 bat and I hope he continues to perform consistently. 

Hemang Badani displayed fine approach. That youngsters are playing the lead roles in winning matches is a good sign for Indian cricket. Not only will they have the established ones on their toes but the country will soon have a pool to choose from. 

It is the bowling front that is worrying, spin especially. I think we need to blood some of the young spinners who are waiting in the wings, thereby developing a pool to choose from. 

It is important for our batsmen to convert their 20s and 30s into bigger scores. India could well have scored 300-plus had Sourav Ganguly and the rest converted their starts after having got their eye in. 

England's batting seems to be its weak-link, while India does look the better and more balanced of the two sides.
