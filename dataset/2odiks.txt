On a pitch not playing any tricks, against an attack not more than ordinary, and chasing a very gettable target, India blew a fine opportunity. 

The second ODI at Cuttack brought to the fore the fact that our batsmen cannot handle pressure. The Indians must be among the poorest chasers in world cricket despite all the `hype and projection.' 

There is far too much dependence on the opening combination and the middle-order invariably comes apart during crunch situations. Considering that the present middle-order lacks experience, the situation was even worse this time. 

Chasing 251, all that the Indians needed to do was to bat with common sense after Tendulkar and Dinesh Mongia got that partnership going. Instead, they crumbled with the run-outs not making things any easier. It is clear that had India lasted the fifty overs, it would have won. 

We keep harping about the fact that we are a wonderful one-day side, with a brilliant set of players, but the results suggest otherwise. If an English attack with the likes of Ben Hollioake, Paul Collingwood and Jeremy Snape can humble India at home, then God save Indian cricket. 

There has been much talk about preparing for the 2003 World Cup, but we have to take action for the `present' than the `future'. And it should be drastic taking nothing but performance into account. 

Considering their mediocre talent levels into account, a word of praise for the England team would not be out of place for the side, at least, played to the best of its ability. Actually, the Indians were lucky to get away in Kolkata. 

Finally, to the mess up with the toss. The Indians should have batted first since their abysmal record while chasing any challenging target is well known. It just did not make sense.
