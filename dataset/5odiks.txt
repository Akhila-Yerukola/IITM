You can trust the Indians not to cash in on gilt-edged opportunities. We saw yet another example of this during the fifth ODI in Delhi.

India was off to an electrifying start, and then after a slight stumble, recovered well and appeared to be coasting to victory when skipper Sourav Ganguly perished to a horrendous stroke, which was the turning point of the game.

Now, Ganguly had taken his time to settle down and it was the responsibility of the captain to see the team home, considering the inexperience in the line-up. He clearly failed.

The match produced an exciting finish thanks to Ajit Agarkar's late heroics with the willow, yet the contest should have been settled in India's favour much earlier. And one wishes that Agarkar is more consistent with his batting.

What rankles this columnist is that India did not succumb to any quality pace bowling, but to the rather pedestrian left-arm spin of Ashley Giles. The Indian batsmen's shot- selection against Giles left much to be desired and it was evident that the pressure was telling on them. All they had to do was to bat with common sense.

Actually, England captain Nasser Hussain deserves much credit for Giles' success. The left-arm spinner was hit out of the attack in his first spell of five overs and it was indeed brave of Hussain to bring Giles back in the climactic phase.

Especially at a stage when Ganguly, a clean striker of the ball against the spinners, was still at the crease. It was a calculated risk and it worked for England and Hussain.

On a disappointing day, when the Indians could not even capitalise on the fielding and catching lapses of the Englishmen, Mohammed Kaif's sensible batting in his first ODI promised much for the future. He displayed a cool head and rotated the strike well.

Earlier, the Indian bowlers did well to come back in the end overs on a flat track, but credit is due to Nick Knight for a well-paced hundred.
